# music
Flare RPG game music mods. They are definitely not for everyone. We are planning to add more overhauls. If you have something – pull requests are very welcome. There are only three rules:

1) Song authors **has to be credited** and you **need to have their permission** (ideally they should be **Creative Commons** licensed).
2) Mod need to be **volume balanced**, so there are not extremely loud or silent tracks.
3) It can be on ‘strange’ side, but let’s stay reasonable, this repo should allow for various music tastes, but also should keep standards as high as possible.

**Work in progress mods are also very welcome here.**

## Empyrean Campaign music

1) psytrance - WIP but usable psytrance and ambient music for Flare RPG. Most tracks are in the ambient side, so no beats. But there are few more energetic tracks. Mod add more tracks then original, but keeps frequency of changes the same (we do not want jump to different track every minute). Also once script music functionality is used(st_maria3.txt).

Psytrance TODO:
- looking for main menu theme,
- more gameplay testing,
- make sure, that tracks are long enough.

This repo needs a little more work and I should look for more people to join `flaremods` organization. I do not want to be "king" here and would be great to make it mod central for user Flare mods.

**So if you want to join me, please open an Issue!**
